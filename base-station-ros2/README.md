# Cougars Base Station ROS Workspace

Add nodes here to run base station programs that interface with the base station modem

WARNING: base-station-ros2 uses seatrac and seatrac_interfaces packages from cougars-ros2. Use "bash build.sh" to build this workspace instead of running
"colcon build" directly.
